This tool is commonly used for managing and automating the deployment and configuration of Mac systems in enterprise environments. Here’s a brief overview of how you can use symhelper to add or remove packages and policies:

sh
Copy code
cd /usr/local/bin
Add a Package:

Use the symhelper command to add a package to the SYM configuration.
sh
Copy code
sudo symhelper add-package /path/to/package.pkg
Replace /path/to/package.pkg with the actual path to the package file you want to add.
Add a Policy:

Use symhelper to add a policy. Policies are usually defined in configuration files.
sh
Copy code
sudo symhelper add-policy /path/to/policy.conf
Replace /path/to/policy.conf with the path to your policy configuration file.
Removing Packages/Policies Using symhelper:

sudo symhelper add-policy /Users/username/Documents/my_policy.conf
Removing a Package:

Verifying Changes:
After adding or removing packages or policies, it’s a good practice to verify the changes to ensure they have been applied correctly.

sudo symhelper list-packages
sudo symhelper list-policies
These commands will list the currently configured packages and policies, allowing you to confirm that the additions or removals were successful.

Notes:
Always ensure you have the necessary administrative privileges when using symhelper.
Backup your current SYM configuration before making any changes to avoid accidental data loss or misconfiguration.
Refer to the official documentation or help command (symhelper --help) for additional options and detailed usage instructions.
